* Semantic Roles
A semantic role is the underlying relationship that a participant has
with the main verb in a clause.

- accompaniment :: the semantic role of a thing that participates in
     close association with an agent, causer, or affected in an event
- agent :: the semantic role of a person or thing who is the doer of
     an event
  - force :: the semantic role of an entity that instigates an action,
       but not consciously or voluntarily
  - causer :: the semantic role of the referent which instigates an
       event rather than actually doing it.
  - counteragent :: the semantic role of a force or resistance against
- beneficiary :: the semantic role of a referent which is advantaged
     or disadvantaged by an event.
     which an action is carried out
- dative :: the semantic role of a referent that is conscious of being
     affected by the state or action identified by the verb.
  - also known as Recipient
- experiencer :: the semantic role of an entity (or referent) which
  - receives
  - accepts
  - experiences
  - undergoes the effect of an action.
- factitive :: the semantic role of an referent that results from the
     action or state identified by a verb
- goal :: the semantic role of the
  - place to which something moves, or
  - thing toward which an action is directed.
- instrument :: the semantic role of an inanimate thing that an agent
     uses to implement an event. It is the stimulus or immediate
     physical cause of an event
- locative :: a semantic role which identifies the location or spatial
     orientation of a state or action. A locative semantic role does
     not imply motion to, from, or across the location.
- manner :: a semantic role that notes how the action, experience, or
     process of an event is carried out.
- measure :: a semantic role which notes the quantification of an
     event
- path :: the semantic role describing the locale(s) transversed in
     motion or propulsion predications.
- patient :: a semantic role that is usually the surface object of the
     verb in a sentence. Also known as affected, undergoer
- range :: the semantic role of the entity that completes, is a
     product of, or further specifies an event.
- result :: a semantic role that refers to that which is produced by
     an event. This role is usually encoded as the surface object of a
     sentence.
- source :: Source is the semantic role of the following referents:
  - The place of origin (with verbs of motion, locomotion, and
    propulsion)
  - The entity from which a physical sensation emanates (with verbs of
    sensation, attention, and speech)
  - The original owner in a transfer (with verbs of acquisition,
    transfer, and grab)
- time :: the semantic role of the temporal placement of an event.

* Grammatical Categories
  	
A grammatical category is a set of syntactic features that
  	
  - express meanings from the same conceptual domain
  - occur in contrast to each other, and
  - are typically expressed in the same fashion.


- aspect :: a grammatical category associated with verbs that
     expresses a temporal view of the event or state expressed by the
     verb.
- case :: a grammatical category determined by the syntactic or
     semantic function of a noun or pronoun.
- definiteness :: a category concerned with the grammaticalization of
     identifiability and nonidentifiability of referents on the part
     of a speaker or addressee.
- mood :: one of a set of distinctive forms that are used to signal
     modality.
  - modality :: a facet of illocutionary force, signaled by
       grammatical devices (that is, moods), that expresses:
    - the illocutionary point or general intent of a speaker, or
    - a speakerâ€™s degree of commitment to the expressed proposition's
      believability, obligatoriness, desirability, or reality.
- noun class :: a grammatical system that some languages use to
     overtly categorize nouns. Noun classes are:
  - often based, at least in part, on characteristics (such as gender,
    animacy, shape) of the referents of some of the nouns in each
    class
  - distinguished by:
    - an affix on the noun or by a clitic or word in the noun phrase
    - agreement affixes on noun phrase constituents and on the verb
- number :: a grammatical category of nouns, pronouns, and verb
     agreement that expresses count distinctions (such as "one" or
     "more than one").
  - The count distinctions typically, but not always, correspond to
    the actual count of the referents of the marked noun or pronoun.
- polarity :: a grammatical category that distinguishes affirmative
     and negative.
- tense :: a grammatical category, typically marked on the verb, that
     deictically refers to the time of the event or state denoted by
     the verb in relation to some other temporal reference point.
- transitivity :: the number of objects a verb requires or takes in a
     given instance. See also Valency.
- voice :: a grammatical category that expresses the semantic
     functions attributed to the referents of a clause. It indicates
     whether the subject is an:
  - actor
  - patient
  - recipient
