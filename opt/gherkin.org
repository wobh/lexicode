* Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
 
- In order to realize a named business value
- As an explicit system actor
- I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal

** Rules:
- an invariant of situation, behavior, or data
- another one

** Background:
- Given a precondition shared by subsequent scenarios
  - And another one

*** Scenario: a situation requiring the above defined background

** Scenario: Some determinable business situation
- Given some precondition
  - And some other precondition
  - When some action by the actor
    - And some other action
    - And yet another action
  - Then some testable outcome is achieved
    - And something else we can check happens too

** Scenario: A different situation

** Scenario Outline:
- Given an entity with <property>
  - When we exercise the entity
  - Then the outcome should be <result>
