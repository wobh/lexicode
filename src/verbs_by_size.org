- set (setup, setdown, setout, reset, offset, typeset, upset)
- let (letup, letdown, letout, sublet)
- cut (cutdown, cutup, cutout, undercut)
- shut (shutdown, shutup, shutout)
- put (putdown, putup, putout)
- fit (retrofit)
- cast (forecast, recast, broadcast, miscast)
- quit
- cost
- read
- bet
- bid

Less useful for todo lists:

- hit
