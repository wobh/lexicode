* Verbs with the same written form of past and present tense

Because when TODO changes to DONE it's nice to not have to go change the verb form.

In their base case, these seem more useful for todo lists:

- set (setup, setdown, setout, reset, offset, typeset, upset)
- let (letup, letdown, letout, sublet)
- cut (cutdown, cutup, cutout, undercut)
- shut (shutdown, shutup, shutout)
- put (putdown, putup, putout)
- fit (retrofit, refit)
- cast (forecast, recast, broadcast, miscast)
- quit
- cost
- read
- bet
- bid

Less useful for todo lists:

- hit
- wet
- spit
- slit
- beat
- shed
- hurt
- burst
- wed
