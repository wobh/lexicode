**** dependent

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A dependent variable is also known as a "response variable",
"regressand", "measured variable", "responding variable", "explained
variable", "outcome variable", "experimental variable", and "output
variable".

If the independent variable is referred to as an "explanatory
variable" (see above) then the term "response variable" is preferred
by some authors for the dependent variable.
#+END_QUOTE
**** independent
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
An independent variable is also known as a "predictor variable",
"regressor", "controlled variable", "manipulated variable",
"explanatory variable", "exposure variable" (see reliability theory),
"risk factor" (see medical statistics), "feature" (in machine
learning and pattern recognition) or an "input variable."

"Explanatory variable" is preferred by some authors over "independent
variable" when the quantities treated as "independent variables" may
not be statistically independent.

Independent variable(s) may be of these kinds: continuous
variable(s), binary/dichotomous variable(s), nominal categorical
variable(s), ordinal categorical variable(s), among others.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A variable may be thought to alter the dependent or independent
variables, but may not actually be the focus of the experiment. So
that variable will be kept constant or monitored to try to minimise
its effect on the experiment. Such variables may be called a
"controlled variable" or "control variable" or "extraneous variable".

Extraneous variables, if included in a regression as independent
variables, may aid a researcher with accurate response parameter
estimation, prediction, and goodness of fit, but are not of
substantive interest to the hypothesis under examination. For example,
in a study examining the effect of post-secondary education on
lifetime earnings, some extraneous variables might be gender,
ethnicity, social class, genetics, intelligence, age, and so forth. A
variable is extraneous only when it can be assumed (or shown) to
influence the dependent variable. If included in a regression, it can
improve the fit of the model. If it is excluded from the regression
and if it has a non-zero covariance with one or more of the
independent variables of interest, its omission will bias the
regression's result for the effect of that independent variable of
interest. This effect is called confounding or omitted variable bias;
in these situations, design changes and/or statistical control is
necessary.

Extraneous variables are often classified into three types:

1. Subject variables, which are the characteristics of the individuals
   being studied that might affect their actions. These variables
   include age, gender, health status, mood, background, etc.
2. Experimental variables are characteristics of the persons
   conducting the experiment which might influence how a person
   behaves. Gender, the presence of racial discrimination, language,
   or other factors may qualify as such variables.
3. Situational variables are features of the environment in which the
   study or research was conducted, which have a bearing on the
   outcome of the experiment in a negative way. Included are the air
   temperature, level of activity, lighting, and the time of day.

In quasi-experiments, differentiating between dependent and other
variables may be downplayed in favour of differentiating between those
variables that can be altered by the researcher and those that
cannot. Variables in quasi-experiments may be referred to as
"extraneous variables", "subject variables", "experimental variables",
"situational variables", "pseudo-independent variables", "ex post
facto variables", "natural group variables" or "non-manipulated
variables".

In modelling, variability that is not covered by the explanatory
variable is designated by ei and is known as the "residual", "side
effect", "error", "unexplained share", "residual variable", or
"tolerance".
